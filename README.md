I will show you how to easily block the servers hosting Spotify ads on your Linux/Mac or Windows machine. 
This will allow you to listen all day long on a free account without hearing a single ad or being tracked by third party. This trick is very simple, legal and works great.

When the traffic hits out local machine the call will fail and the ad will be skipped.
